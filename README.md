Student Budget and Savings Tracker is a smart all in one personal finance application built to help students automate their financial discipline and track their wealth in real time. It goes beyond simple expense tracking by using a Pay Yourself First algorithm that automatically detects income and instantly directs 20 percent toward savings goals before the user has a chance to spend it.

The platform includes a Monthly Budget Manager with visual health indicators that show green, orange, or red when a spending category is approaching a risky level. It also provides dedicated tools for tracking peer to peer debts and monitoring savings progress. All these features come together to give students a secure and central place to manage their personal finances without the stress of doing everything manually.
